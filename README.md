#Pichicho Defender
###(a.k.a. bombit)

Pichicho Defender is a simple game written in Javascript.

It is meant as a birthday present for a friend (who when transformed into a crappy 8-bit sprite, looks just the player character).
Said friend is known to love dogs, and hate zombies. To his surprise, when the zombies finally invade his lawn, they turn out to see dogs as the tastiest of treats, while showing no real interest in human friends. So much for cliches.
His dog is not the brightest one on the neighborhood, though. He insists on playing catch even while his very life is endangered.
Lucky for him, our friend can throw mean punches and will do whatever it takes to defend him.

The game is written in pure Javascript, using Create.js to simplify drawing, sound, and resource loading. It is meant to use a mixin-based code reuse pattern, and a lot of is
