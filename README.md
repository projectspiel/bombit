# Pichicho Defender
### (a.k.a. bombit)

[Play the game!](https://projectspiel.github.io/bombit/)

Pichicho Defender is a simple Javascript game, written as a birthday present for a friend (who when transformed into a crappy 8-bit sprite, looks just the player character).

Said friend is known to love dogs, and hate zombies. To his surprise, when the zombies finally invade his lawn, they turn out to consider dogs as the tastiest of treats, while showing no real interest in human brains. So much for zombie clich√©s. His dog is not the brightest one on the neighborhood, though. He insists on playing catch even while his very life is in danger. Lucky for him, our friend can throw mean punches and will do whatever it takes to defend him.

The game uses the Create.js library for drawing, sounds, and resource loading. It served as a playground in which to experiment with various unfamiliar Javascript and game programming patterns and techniques. It is not meant to be clean and tidy code.

### Instructions
Use arrow keys to move, spacebar to throw the ball/punch. The dog will chase after the ball, use it to keep him away from the zombies. After punching a zombie three times in a row, it will give up chasing the dog and leave. If a zombie gets hold of your dog, punch it until it drops it. Once all zombies in a level are defeated, the next wave will come. This will go on until the dog is finally carried away, or you get bored and go do something else. You can't really win here, this is the zombie apocalypse after all.
