#Pichicho Defender
###(a.k.a. bombit)


Pichicho Defender is a simple game written in Javascript, meant as a birthday present for a friend (who when transformed into a crappy 8-bit sprite, looks just the player character).

Said friend is known to love dogs, and hate zombies. To his surprise, when the zombies finally invade his lawn, they turn out to see dogs as the tastiest of treats, while showing no real interest in human brains. So much for zombie clich√©s.His dog is not the brightest one on the neighborhood, though. He insists on playing catch even while his very life is endangered. Lucky for him, our friend can throw mean punches and will do whatever it takes to defend him.

The game is written in pure Javascript, using the Create.js library for drawing, sounds, and resource loading. It served as a playground in which to experiment with various unfamiliar JS patterns, and is not meant to be clean and tidy.
